> "Do not run, do not back down, face every issue and do not rest till you work it out with the people here."

> "No one here is worthless and we are going to prove that!"

-Trixie

> Oh believe me, I understand that. In a different comment I made the point that player->dev harassment is widespread and not limited to one particular demographic. This comment tree was specifically addressing this week's drama, so I focused my reply on the misogynistic angle.
I'm pretty sensitive to attacks on female game designers, because my wife is one and she's had some pretty bad experiences (though nothing compared to what happened this week). The industry and the community are actively hostile towards women in gaming, and it breaks my heart because my wife worked her ass off to get where she is and she's still treated like a second-class citizen (at best) or a non-person (at worst).
