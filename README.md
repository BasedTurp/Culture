Actual Rules
============

The following are the only core rules and policies, in no particular order.

- Jamezs "AccessDenied" Gladney is singularly incharge. Everyone else is an equal under him.
    - Violation of this or direct insubortnation will result in being asked and/or potentially strong armed, into leaving the project.
    - Pay attention for, **"... thats an order."** It significes invoking this clause.
- If there is a problem with the software file a bug.
- Do not take work you can not complete in a timely manner, or show progress of completing.
- We are making software for users, not developers. Dont make things that are locked to one operating system, lack ui, require many dependencies or require crafted non-default configuration.
    - Setup should be as few steps as possible.
- Do not leave the development room in an argumentative state, this signifies the same as abandoning your post. You forfeit administrative privileges and and staff status by doing this.
- Use version control, this is not negotiable.


Culture
=======

A collection of the top to middle socially adjusted mildly depressed YGO Players world wide. They are dicks, perverted, spastic, nerdy, anxious, akward, patient, helpful, innovative, and concerned with the mental well being and happiness of those around them. They possess great problem solving and communication skills. They are passionate about Yu-Gi-Oh! and connecting with others.

- People are the most important asset.
- Be honest, with your coworkers and self.
- For the user experience, make the right thing to do the easiest thing to do.
- **Solve problems by fixing the environment that allowed them to occur.**
- It doesn't matter when or how much you work, only that your peers trust you and feel like you are contributing. Minimum work load is simply doing as asked in a prompt manner.
- Document everything.
- Don't hire people, people will hire themselves.
- If you work in the dark and by yourself, you are working for nothing.
- Unicorns, unicorns everywhere.


**Development Practices**
- Use Github, and commit often.
- Work off a branch, except during core development.
- File bug reports/issues, and setup a task list for what you are doing.
- Dont break `master`.
- **Code in `JavaScript` or `Go`.** C# and C++ exist in our codebase we are trying to get away from those!
- No `Ruby`, `Java`, `Python`,`C`, no whatever other language you are thinking of!
- No `CoffeeScript`, `TypeScript`, or `Dart`!

**Quotes**
> "Do not run, do not back down, face every issue and do not rest till you work it out with the people here."
> "Anarchy works wonderfully in a small group of individuals with a high level of trust, the ygo community is not such a group of people."

> "No one here is worthless and we are going to prove that!"

-Trixie


> "...you have a decision to make. 1. Let it go, move on, join the chat and live it up. 2. Confront the people and come to a positive resolution or 3. Simply don't come here. All 3 of those choices are yours. Coming here and being an asshole just because you can and you're still mad about what happened isn't one of them."

-Ryder
