Culture
=======

Notes from the development room. Explains the company culture, must see and read.

**General**
- People are the most important asset.
- Be honest, with your coworkers and self.
- Make the right thing to do the easiest thing to do.
- **Solve problems by fixing the environment that allowed them to occur.**
- It doesn't matter when or how much you work, only that your peers trust you and feel like you are contributing.
- Document everything.
- Don't hire people, people will hire themselves.
- If you work in the dark and by yourself, you are working for nothing.
- Unicorns, unicorns everywhere.

**Generalization of the Personnel**

A collection of the top to middle socially adjusted mildly depressed YGO Players world wide. They are dicks, perverted, spastic, nerdy, anxious, akward, patient, helpful, innovative, and conserned with the mental well being and happiness of those around them.

**Quotes**
> "Do not run, do not back down, face every issue and do not rest till you work it out with the people here."
> "Anarchy works wonderfully in a small group of individuals with a high level of trust, the ygo community is not such a group of people."

-Access

> "No one here is worthless and we are going to prove that!"

-Trixie

> "...you have a decision to make. 1. Let it go, move on, join the chat and live it up. 2. Confront the people and come to a positive resolution or 3. Simply don't come here. All 3 of those choices are yours. Coming here and being an asshole just because you can and you're still mad about what happened isn't one of them."

> Oh believe me, I understand that. In a different comment I made the point that player->dev harassment is widespread and not limited to one particular demographic. This comment tree was specifically addressing this week's drama, so I focused my reply on the misogynistic angle.
I'm pretty sensitive to attacks on female game designers, because my wife is one and she's had some pretty bad experiences (though nothing compared to what happened this week). The industry and the community are actively hostile towards women in gaming, and it breaks my heart because my wife worked her ass off to get where she is and she's still treated like a second-class citizen (at best) or a non-person (at worst).

Actual Rules
============

The following are the only core rules and policies, in no particular order.

- Jamezs "AccessDenied" Gladney is singularly incharge. Everyone else is an equal under him.
    - Violation of this or direct insubortnation will result in being asked and strong armed into leaving the project.
    - Pay attention for, **"... thats an order."** It significes invoking this clause.
- SalvationDevelopment is specially commited to making women comfortable in the Yu-Gi-Oh community. Thus if she so cares, a women may contact the staff and be placed in a position of realitive power above normal users and below staff solely on the basis of gender to enable them to protect themselves and guide the community mindset.
    - [Women tend to see the larger relationship picture](http://www.psychologytoday.com/blog/ironshrink/201403/why-men-feel-outmatched-during-arguments-women), in general. They have better insight into why issues are happening.
    - Limits "white knight wars", the women in our community are very capable. Thus this behavior is a mind game.
    - Limits verification harassment to a single at will instance with trusted and respected community leaders.
- If there is a problem with the software file a bug.
- Do not take work you can not complete in a timely manner, or show progress of completing.
