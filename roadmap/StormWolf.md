My wishlist

-The implementation of BP03 draft play

-A way to filter out cards not printed IRL from Ranked duels

-The option to right-click out of picking materials for a Tribute/Synchro/Xyz/etc. to cancel the action

-An integrated system for exchanging deck and replay files

-Implement the 2v1 option that Checkmate has

-Implement Boss Dueling

-Implement hand shuffling

-Make it easier for members to know about the additional game modes such as BP3 Sealed, Anime, Goats, and Newgioh. It also is annoying how people don't know that they need to switch their database to use the pre-errata'd cards 

-A way to differentiate conflicting TCG rulings from OCG rulings

-A chat log similar to Percy's YGOPro

-A way to rewind turns when watching a Replay

-Have Salv remember the last database selected

-Extra sorting features for Deck Edit

-Have Salv appear like a viable option for players to prepare for IRL tournaments

-Customization for textures like DevPro

-The option to automatically issue a rematch with an opponent after a duel ends

-Keep all cards up-to-date on TCG/OCG status and wording
