# My aims for joining:

* A mobile client. Whether its based on YGOpro or something else entirely (like the attempt from Industrial Illusions and YVD), the mobile market is too vacant to ignore this option.

* Establishing a place that provides all the scattered needs and resources of the YGO community in a singular bundled package. This may include stuff like reviving the Yugioh decks wiki as our own, except more elaborate than the original.

* Work to improve and gradually make both the place and the products visually more impressionable. 

* Have the excuse to further work on current skillset as well as begin practice on newer ones: Graphic Design, HTML/CSS and Site/Content Management (Joomla, Wordpress and various forum software)

* Provide input, bug reports and suggestions for advancing the development of the client.

* To settle unfinished ideas and have the place be a stepping stone to something much bigger. Not very relevent given its current state, but still worth the mention for future.

# My beliefs:
* Innovation. Being able to think/consider untouched areas and rather than submitting to the impossible, always aim for the closest thing to it until eventually that mark becomes reachable. The options that are present, the options that were abandoned and the options that were foreseen, being able to acknowledge each as something relevent and balance up the right idea through them. 
* Foresight. Aside from being creative in one's approach, calculation is also a must. While YGO is a primary target of audience, it shouldn't be limited to just that. Being able to perceive the bigger picture namely the card game industry in general, and then having the capacity to explore it in terms of how both the site and the product's use itself can be expanded.
* A tangible plan. Something that doesn't only sound real, but actually IS by every definition. If the plan is too big to keep track of, divide it into smaller stages. Set sights on the "End Game" but maintain the same amount of committment and focus in completing one stage as if it were the entire plan. 
* Motivation. Working on this project shouldn't be for the sake of something petty, like personal grudges or believing that a reasonable sum of finance will be gained from this. The goal itself is much bigger than that and it would only derail work if the vision behind it is not a shared one.
