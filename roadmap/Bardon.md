# My aims for joining:

* A mobile client. Whether its based on YGOpro or something else entirely (like the attempt from Industrial Illusions and YVD), the mobile market is too vacant to ignore this option.

* Establishing a place that provides all the scattered needs and resources of the YGO community in a singular bundled package. This may include stuff like reviving the Yugioh decks wiki as our own, except more elaborate than the original.

* Work to improve and gradually make both the place and the products visually more impressionable. 

* Have the excuse to further work on current skillset as well as begin practice on newer ones: Graphic Design, HTML/CSS and Site/Content Management (Joomla, Wordpress and various forum software)

* Provide input, bug reports and suggestions for advancing the development of the client.

* To settle unfinished ideas and have the place be a stepping stone to something much bigger. Not very relevent given its current state, but still worth the mention for future.
